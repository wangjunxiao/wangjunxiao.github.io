<h2>About Me</h2>

<!--
I'm broadly interested in artificial intelligence system with a special focus on generative AI, distributed machine learning, AI security, privacy and interpretability.
-->

<p>Research objective: To construct a co-evolutionary paradigm between humans and artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>My core research goal is to address one of the most fundamental challenges facing humanity in the intelligent age: how to ensure that increasingly powerful general artificial intelligence systems are fundamentally aligned and integrated with humanity's long-term well-being, core values, and the continuity of civilization. This is not simply a matter of technological optimization, but a grand project concerning the future form of the human species.</p>

<p>To achieve this ultimate goal, my research abandoned a single technical approach and instead constructed an interdisciplinary, multi-layered collaborative research framework:</p>

<li><p><b>Alignment of Value Layers: Using Large Language Models as Value Carriers and Dialogue Interfaces.</b> AI is not merely a tool, but a "compressed mirror image" of human knowledge and value systems. My research aims to transcend its surface capabilities and delve into its "black box", exploring how to encode complex, ambiguous, and dynamically evolving human values, ethical principles, and cultural contexts into abstract representations that machines can understand and reason about. This is not only about enabling AI to "understand" human instructions, but also about enabling it to "internalize" our intentions, emotions, and moral judgments, thereby establishing a trustworthy intelligent agent with profound humanistic foundations.</p></li>


<li><p><b>Alignment of the Interaction Layer: Brain-Computer Interfaces as the Ultimate Bridge for Perception and Feedback.</b> To break through the constraints of symbols and semantics, I explored the cutting-edge field of brain-computer interfaces, aiming to build a high-bandwidth, low-latency perception and feedback loop for humans and AI. This is not merely about translating will into commands, but also about establishing an "empathy channel," allowing AI to more directly perceive human intentions, confusion, and sparks of creativity, while simultaneously enabling humans to more intuitively understand AI's "thought processes." This offers the possibility of a paradigm shift from "external command alignment" to "internal experience integration".</p></li>

<li><p><b>Alignment of Constraints: AI Security and Privacy as the Cornerstone of Civilization.</b>Any evolution must be built on a foundation of security. My research views AI security and privacy as the "immune system" of this grand project. This includes, but is not limited to: ensuring the robustness, interpretability, and disruptibility of AI systems; embedding the core concept of "design as privacy" throughout the entire lifecycle of data flow and model collaboration, safeguarding the digital sovereignty of individuals and collectives. This ensures that while pursuing the pinnacle of intelligence, human autonomy and dignity are fundamentally protected.</p></li>

<p>In summary, my research vision transcends the traditional "master-servant" or "creator-creation" relationship, ushering in a new era of "co-evolution" between humans and artificial intelligence. By deeply integrating these four areas, I aim to pave a solid path for the future relationship between humans and machines—a path where artificial intelligence is not only a powerful tool, but also a true "partner" for us to expand the boundaries of our cognition, address complex challenges, and ultimately achieve the sublimation of civilization.</p>
