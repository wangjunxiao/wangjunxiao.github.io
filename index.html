<h2>About Me</h2>

I'm broadly interested in artificial intelligence system with a special focus on generative AI, distributed machine learning, AI security, privacy and interpretability.

<p><font color="#FF0000">If you're interested in a research internship (remote), I welcome applicants of all levels (PhD/MSc/BSc). Don't hesitate to send me an email!</font> 
</p>


<!--
<p>I currently hold the position of Postdoctoral Fellow at the KAUST <a href="http://www.pradalab.org">Provable Responsible AI and Data Analytics (PRADA) Laboratory</a>, working with <a href="https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/cs/people/person/di-wang">Assistant Prof. Di Wang</a>.
</p>

<p>In 2023-2024, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the KAUST <a href="http://www.pradalab.org">Provable Responsible AI and Data Analytics (PRADA) Laboratory</a>, working with <a href="https://shao3wangdi.github.io/">Assistant Prof. Di Wang. In 2021-2023, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the <a href="https://peilab.netlify.app">Pervasive Edge Intelligence Laboratory (PEIL)</a> of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, working with <a href="https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~songguo/">Prof. Song Guo</a>. In 2018-2019, I was a Visiting Student at the <a href="http://networks.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/">Networks Research Group</a> of Queen Mary University of London, working with <a href="http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~steve/">Prof. Steve Uhlig</a>. I completed my PhD at Dalian University of Technology in 2020, where my mentor was <a href="http://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/likeqiu/keqiu.html">Prof. Keqiu Li</a>. Prior to that, I earned my MEng and BE degrees in 2017, 2014.
